# Todo-React

This is my first project.
It is a simple To do list built in Next.js
I used Cypress to test the functionality of the site and am using Vercel to host the site.
I used the built-in react context hook to help reduce prop drilling

What is one of the things I learned from this project? using fetch in next.js is not as easy as I expected it would be. I attempted to use firebase to store completed todos, but was unable to successfully connect to the api folder, as well as the database. I believe this has to do with route pre-fetching, but was unable to test further due to time constraints. I also learned it is easy to use nextjs with its pages folder and server side rendering.
